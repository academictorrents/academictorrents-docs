We recommend the Transmission torrent client which supports all major operating systems: [https://www.transmissionbt.com/](https://www.transmissionbt.com/)


## From the command line

We recommend [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/). Specity a torrent URL or the magnet link to download.

```bash
$ aria2c https://academictorrents.com/download/c5af268ec55cf2d3b439e7311ad43101ba8322eb.torrent
```
